# Buddy - Back-End API

Buddy is a personal safety iOS app with three main features:
1. Users can invite friends to follow along on their trips using a web browser. Friends do not need to download the app! A URL link is sent out via a text message.
2. At the press of a button, the trip webpage will be updated with a danger status. Additionally emergency contacts saved to the app will get a text alert, notifying them that the user does not feel safe. 
3. The Check-In feature sends a text alert to emergency contacts if the user has not returned to a saved location (home, work, or school) within a designated time period. 

This repository contains the code for the back-end API.
